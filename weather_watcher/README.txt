1. Using html tables to display the weather in tabular form. I thought it would be appropriate to use it in this instance.

2. I wasn't sure whether the use of CSS in Javascript was alright, but I went ahead and used it because the changes in CSS was triggered by Javascript. 

3. The queries I have in my php are in lower case. I'm not sure if other OS are case sensitive, I was told Unix tend to be one, but in Windows it's not. Unfortunately I wasn't able to test my program in the labs so in case there are errors in the database queries, this maybe the reason. 

I've provided a commented code to connect to the database as we normally would in the labs however, I haven't tested this at all in the labs so I'm not sure whether it will connect properly. 

4. I've created a new table called 'join' that has 'uid' and town name. This holds the user's list of towns they can view.
